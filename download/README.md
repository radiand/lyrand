where `EXPORTIFY_CSV_FILE` is a .csv generated by [Exportify](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) and has following layout:

```csv

```

# installation

[Manually](https://github.com/sahib/glyr/wiki/Compiling) compile and install `glyr`.
Don't use your Linux distrubution packages manager to install `libglyr-dev` because it is probably
outdated and does not include patches to properly parse lyrics providers.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
