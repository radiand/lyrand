# lyrand (LYrics in RANDom)

Generate brand new lyrics out of given ones. Verses can be completely random, rhyme or have specified number of syllables.

## what?

The idea was to fetch my Spotify playlist, download all lyrics and mix them up to see what happens.

To improve the experience, **lyrand** has implemented (let's be honest - in a very naive way)
following features:

* randomly mix all tracks and cut to specified number of lines (`--max-lines=<NUM>`)
* mix verses that rhyme in AABB manner (`--rhymes`)
* mix only verses that have specified number of syllables (`--syllables=<NUM>`)

## usage

```bash
python3 -m lyrand LYRICS.json --max-lines 10 --syllables 13 --print-origin
```

where `LYRICS.json` is a file generated by [lyrand-download](https://github.com/radiand/lyrand-downloader) module and has following layout:

```json
[
    [
        "artist",
        "title",
        "verse1\nverse2\nverse3
    ],
    [
        ...same again for another track
    ],
    ...
]
```

## installation

```bash
pip3 install .
```

## development

```bash
pip3 install -e .
tox -e py37  # or any other tox.ini command...
```
